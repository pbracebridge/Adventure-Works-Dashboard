# Adventure-Works-Dashboard

This Power BI project was developed as part of the *Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence* training by Maven Analytics, Chris Dutton and Aaron Parry, with personalized modifications to reflect my own analytical focus and visual preferences.

The dashboard involves importing multiple CSV datasets, building a star schema data model, transforming data using Power Query, and creating calculated measures using DAX. The result is a multi-page interactive report providing insights tailored for various business users.

# 📊 Report Pages

The report consists of three audience-specific pages:

1. **Executive Summary**  
   A high-level overview of sales performance, key metrics, and return trends.

2. **Map / Regional Orders**  
   A geospatial breakdown of order volumes across countries and regions.

3. **Customer Details Report**  
   A deeper dive into customer profiles, including demographics and purchasing behavior.

# 🗂️ Dataset Information
The dataset is based on the fictional AdventureWorks company — a global manufacturer of cycling equipment and accessories — and was provided as part of the Maven Analytics Power BI training course. All data is synthetic and used for educational purposes. The dataset includes:
